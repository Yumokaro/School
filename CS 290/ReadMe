    I like the color scheme, text font, and simple menu at the top

    I like the menu and how it follows down the page.  Subjects are organized in a grid by button.

    Menu is simple.  I would change the contents table to be on the left to feel more natural.

    I like how there are two menus.  I like that the text is emphasized by being larger than all of the surrounding text.

    I love how the instruction area is set up.  I feel like the pages are too busy and distracting.
